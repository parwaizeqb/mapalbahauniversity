              	This document describes the elements available in this web map application and their usage


              	<hr class="col-md-12">

              	<a name="layerslist"></a><h2>Layers list</h2><p>The layer list shows the layers in the application and allows managing them. Pass the mouse pointer over the layers list icon or click on it to display the layers list</p>

<img src="help_layerslist.png"/>

<p>A check box is shown along the name of each layer, which allows to toggle its visibility<p>.

<p>The opacity of the layer can be controlled using the opacity slider.</p>

<p>Rendering order of layers can be modified using the arrows to bring a given layer up or down the layers list. Layers on top are rendered at the end, and will have rendering priority.</p>

<p>For vector layers, a <i>Zoom to</i> button will be available. Clicking on it will cause the map extent to be changed to the minimum extent that covers all the features in the layer.</p>

<p>A <i>download</i> button will also be available for vector layers, allowing to download the layer as a GeoJson file</p>

<p>Rendering filters can be added to vector layers. Clicking on the filter icon will show the filter dialog</p>

<img src="help_layerslist_filter.png"/>

<p>To add a new filter, enter its expression in the text box and click the <i>Add</i> button.</p>

<p>All active filters are listed below the text box. Click on the <i>Remove</i> link to remove a filter.</p>

<p>Filters use the following syntax of the Filtrex library, as described <a href="https://github.com/joewalnes/filtrex#expressions">here.</a> Attribute names are used as variables. Attribute names are case-sensitive</p>

<a name="edit"></a><h2>Edit</h2><p>The edit component allows you to add new layers and features to the map. By clicking on the <i>Edit</i> menu, you will see the edit toolbar</p>

<img src="help_edit_toolbar.png"/>

<p>The dropdown list shows the editable layers in the web app. AT the beginning, it will be empty, since app layers are not editable. You have to add your own editable layers, by clicking on the plus icon on the right side of the dropdown list. You will see the following dialog</p>

<img src="help_edit_new_layer.png"/>

<p>Enter a name for the layer and select the geometry type in the corresponding field. You can also select the color to use when rendering features from this layer.</p>

<p>If you want to add attributes to the layer, enter their names in the <i>Attributes</i> field, separated by commas. If you leave that field empty, the layer will only have geometries, and you wont be prompted to enter attribute values when a new feature is added.

<p>Close the dialog clicking on <i>OK</i> and you will see your new layer in the list of available editable layers. </p>

<img src="help_edit_with_layers.png"/>

Clicking on the <i>Enable edit mode</i> button will set the edit tool. You can now enter new features by clicking on the map canvas to add points, lines or polygons, depending on the geometry type of the layer. In the case of lines and polygons, doubl-click to enter the last point of the geometry.</p>

<p>If the layer has attributes defined in its schema, you will be prompted to enter their values</p>

<img src="help_edit_new_feature_attributes.png"/>

<a name="selectiontools"></a><h2>Selection</h2><p>Selection tools are used to select features in the vector layers of the web app that allow selection. Two selection tools are available: Select by Polygon and Select by Rectangle</p>

<p>If the <i>Select by Polygon</i> tool is active, you can click on the map canvas to define polygon vertices. Close the polygon by double-clicking. When the polygon is closed, all features in all selectable layers which are within the polygon will get selected. Previous selection, if it exist will be removed.</p>

<p>If the <i>Select by Rectangle</i> tool is active, you can click and drag to define a rectangle. All features in all selectable layers which are within the polygon will get selected. Previous selection, if it exist will be removed.</p>

<p>Selected features will be rendered in a yellow color, to differentiate them from non-selected ones.</p>

<a name="print"></a><h2>Print</h2><p>The print component creates ready-to-print PDF documents based on the current map.</p>

<p>In the <i>Print</i> menu, select the layout configuration to use. A new dialog will be opened, to configure the printing operation.</p>

<img src="help_print_dialog.png"/>

<p>Select the resolution to use for the PDF file. A larger resolution will mean a longer time to create the file.</p>

<p>If the layout contains labels, the dialog will include text fields to edit the content of the labels</p>

<p>The extent of the map rendered in the PDF is the current extent of the map viewer in the web app. Adjust it using the pan and zoom controls before opening the print dialog.<p>.

<p>Click on <i>OK</p> to close the dialog and the file will be created and downloaded.</p>

<a name="addlayer"></a><h2>Add layer</h2><p>The "<i>Add layer" button allows to add a new layer to the map.</p>

<p>The following dialog is shown to select the file to load and the color to use for rendering its features in the map.</p>

<img src="help_add_layer.png"/>

<p>Supported formats are GeoJson, GPX and KML. The layer will be added to the map and can be used as any other layer</p>
<a name="attributestable"></a><h2>Attributes table</h2><p>The attributes table shows the attributes of features in the vector layers of the application.</p>

<img src="help_table.png"/>

<p>The dropdown list in the attributes table is used to select the layer for the list of available vector layers.</p>

<p>If selection is allowed for the current layer in the attributes table, features can be selected in the table, by clicking on the corresponding row. The corresponding feature will be highlighted in the canvas. Selected features are also highlighted in the table itself. Selection of multiple features is available using the Ctrl or Shift keys while clicking on a row.</p>

<img src="help_table_selection.png"/>

<p>If you want to see only the features that are selected
<p>The selection for the current layer can be cleared by clicking the <i>Clear selection</i> button.</p>

<p>Clicking on the <i>Zoom to selected</i> button will cause the map to be zoom the the minimum extent that covers all the selected features.</p>

<p>When a rendering filter is applied to the layer, all features will be shown in the attributes table. However, features that do not pass the rendering filters and are not painted in the map will be shown with a lighter font color in the attributes table.</p>

<img src="help_table_withfiltered.png"/>

<p>The list of features in the table can be restricted by using a filter. To show only those features that contain a given string in any of their attributes, type the filter string in the filter box.</p>

<img src="help_table_filter.png"/>

<a name="measuretools"></a><h2>Measure</h2><p>MEasure tools are used to get area and distance measurements over the map canvas.</p>

Two tools are available: Distance and Area.

<img src="help_measuretools.png"/>

<p>Select the distance tool to measure distances. Click on the map to set the points that define the line to measure.</p>

<img src="help_measuretools_distance.png"/>

<p>When you have finished defining the line, double-click to end.</p>

<img src="help_measuretools_distance_finished.png"/>

<p>Select the area tool to measure areas. Click on the map to set the points that define the polygon to measure.</p>

<img src="help_measuretools_area.png"/>

<p>When you have finished defining the line, double-click to end.</p>

<img src="help_measuretools_area_finished.png"/>

<p>To remove the lines and polygons created by the distance and are tools, select the <p>Remove measurements</p> menu.
